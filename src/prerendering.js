 * Browser.html native window shows up once index.html has loaded.
 * By then, the first rendering didn't happen yet because requirejs
 * loads script asynchronously. We use localStorage (which is a synchronous
 * API) to store the result of the previous first rendering (see src/browser/index.js)
 * which we restore here.
 *
 * Ideally, we'd like to be able to write the initial rendering directly
 * into index.html, or maybe load the browser.html machinery synchronously.
